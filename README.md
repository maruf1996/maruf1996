### Hi there 👋, I'm Mariful Islam
#### Front End Developer

I am Mariful Islam, and I am a front-end developer with a proven track record of building modern web applications. I am well-versed in a wide range of technologies, including MongoDB, Express, React, Redux, Next.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Prisma.

In terms of front-end development, I have a deep understanding of JavaScript and am highly proficient in React.js and Next.js, along with their core principles. My experience includes working with popular React.js workflows such as Redux, Redux Toolkit, and RTK. Additionally, I am well-versed in the latest ECMAScript specifications and proficient in TypeScript.

On the backend side, I have substantial experience with Node.js and Express, as well as PostgreSQL and Prisma. I am skilled at designing and implementing RESTful APIs and seamlessly integrating them with MongoDB databases and PostgreSQL. My familiarity with code versioning tools, particularly Git, and my experience with agile development methodologies further enhance my capabilities.

As a dedicated learner, I am committed to staying updated with the latest technologies in web development. My skill set also extends to HTML, CSS, and SCSS, allowing me to create responsive and visually appealing user interfaces. I have hands-on experience with modular-based CSS and can efficiently translate designs and wireframes into high-quality code.

My qualifications, skills, and enthusiasm make me an ideal candidate for the Front-End Developer position at Your Companies. I am eager to contribute to your team and collaborate on the development of innovative web applications.
